~~~
The objective of this project is to provide a streamlined environment for C# development and seamless conversion to standalone EXE files.
~~~
~~~
txteditor.exe is a dedicated text editor for this environment.

1.Add the necessary code to the designated area. Note: The programming language used is C#.

2.Click RUN to test it. You may use any filename as long as it is easy to identify.
~~~
~~~
launcher.exe is used to execute the code you have created.

1.Place the code file created by txteditor.exe into the same directory as launcher.exe.

2.Rename the file to code.c. Please ensure the name is correct, as launcher.exe specifically looks for "code.c" to run.

3.Run launcher.exe.

4.If it runs successfully, a file named temp_run.exe will be generated simultaneously. temp_run.exe contains both launcher.exe and code.c, allowing it to function as a standalone application.
~~~
~~~
Important: Although the file extension is generated as .c, the actual language is C#. Please be careful not to confuse them.

Code Example
By entering the following code, you can display a "Hello World" message: MessageBox.Show("Hello World");
