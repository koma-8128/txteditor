Project Goal
To simplify C# coding and easily convert scripts into executable (.exe) files.

Instructions
Option A: Using txteditor.exe (Recommended)
Add your C# code to the designated area.

Click RUN to test and generate the file.

Note: You do not need to run launcher.exe when using the editor.

Caution: The code.c file in the directory will be overwritten every time you click RUN.


Option B: Manual Method (Without txteditor.exe)
Rename your source file to code.c and place it in the same directory as launcher.exe.

Run launcher.exe.

Output
When successfully executed, temp_run.exe is generated.
~~~
~~~
This file is a standalone executable containing both the launcher and your code.

Reminder: The file extension is .c, but the language must be C#.

Example Code
MessageBox.Show("Hello World");
